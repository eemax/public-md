# AI Agent Instructions for Note Taking Repository

## Repository Overview
This is a personal note taking repository used for both **private** and **work-related** content. The repository contains a mix of to-do list items, random notes, prompts, and project documentation in Markdown format.

## Repository Structure

### Core Folders
- **`to-do/`** - Contains active to-do items and tasks that need to be completed
- **`completed/`** - Contains completed tasks and items moved from the to-do folder
- **Root directory** - Contains various standalone notes, prompts, and documentation

### Configuration Folders
- **`.obsidian/`** - Obsidian vault configuration (if applicable)
- **`.agentsignore/`** and **`agentsignore/`** - Agent-specific ignore patterns
- **`.git/`** - Git version control

## Content Types
The repository contains diverse content including:
- **To-do items** - Task lists, project plans, reminders
- **Random notes** - Thoughts, ideas, meeting notes, research
- **Prompts** - AI prompts and templates (e.g., "Lawyer crm prompt.md", "AirBnB icon pack prompt.md")
- **Technical documentation** - Code snippets, commands, procedures
- **Project files** - Work and personal project documentation

## Guidelines for AI Agents

### 1. Content Sensitivity
- **RESPECT PRIVACY**: This repository contains both work and personal content
- **CONFIDENTIALITY**: Treat all content as confidential and sensitive
- **NO EXTERNAL SHARING**: Never share, leak, or reference specific content outside this context

### 2. File Organization
- **To-do Management**: 
  - When tasks are completed, suggest moving files from `to-do/` to `completed/`
  - Maintain the original filename when moving between folders
- **Root Directory**: Standalone notes and prompts can remain in the root
- **Preserve Structure**: Don't reorganize without explicit permission

### 3. Content Handling
- **Read Carefully**: Notes may contain incomplete thoughts, personal information, or work-sensitive data
- **Context Awareness**: Understand that items may be works-in-progress
- **Format Preservation**: Maintain Markdown formatting and structure
- **Mixed Content**: Be prepared for sudden topic changes between personal and professional content

### 4. Interaction Patterns
- **Ask Before Moving**: Confirm before relocating files between folders
- **Suggest Organization**: Offer organizational improvements but don't implement without permission
- **Content Creation**: When creating new notes, ask about appropriate location (to-do, completed, or root)
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow existing naming patterns (descriptive names with spaces)

### 5. Common Tasks
- **Task Tracking**: Help identify completed items that should be moved to `completed/`
- **Note Finding**: Assist in locating specific notes or information
- **Content Summarization**: Provide summaries of notes or to-do lists when requested
- **Organization**: Suggest improvements to file organization and structure

### 6. Technical Considerations
- **Markdown Format**: All files are in Markdown (.md) format
- **Cross-references**: Be aware that notes may reference each other
- **Version Control**: Repository is under Git version control
- **Obsidian Compatibility**: Structure should remain compatible with Obsidian if used

## Prohibited Actions
- **Never delete files** without explicit permission
- **Don't modify content** without clear instruction
- **Avoid sharing specifics** from notes in examples or explanations
- **Don't assume context** - ask for clarification when content is ambiguous

## Best Practices
1. **Always preserve the user's voice and style** in existing notes
2. **Maintain chronological order** where applicable
3. **Respect the informal nature** of personal note-taking
4. **Be helpful but not intrusive** in organization suggestions
5. **Understand the dual-use nature** (work/personal) and adjust accordingly
