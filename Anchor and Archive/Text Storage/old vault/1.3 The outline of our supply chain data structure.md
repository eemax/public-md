- Note that we don't need to deploy all these requirements at once, but we need to have the structure in place to grow in to it over time.

Data structure, we need LEVELS of data.
1. Product
	1. Product batch (PO) this is literally the DPP
2. Material and material assembly (subprocesses)
	1. Material batch
3. Raw material
	1. Raw material batch

We can select from the generic material or raw material but the optionality to select the batch itself. This would act as a fallback.

We need a library of product, material, and raw materials. We enrich these libraries and avoid being redundant.
We then need to have a batch database of everything. PO, material batch, raw material batch.

The biggest change will be that Segura needs almost a complete rework and we need to heavily involve the buying team to build and maintain our batch libraries.
