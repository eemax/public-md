### Proposed Format:
```
base.com/subcat?01=12345678901234&10=ABC123&17=231231
```
- `01`: GTIN (Global Trade Item Number).
- `10`: Batch number.
- `17`: Expiration date (optional, example: `231231` for December 31, 2023).

### Benefits of This Approach:
4. **Readability**:
   - Each AI and its value are clearly separated by `=` and combined with `&`, making it easy for humans to interpret.
   
5. **Compatibility**:
   - Most programming languages and frameworks can parse query parameters easily (e.g., JavaScript's `URLSearchParams`, Python's `urllib.parse`, etc.).

6. **Flexibility**:
   - Additional AIs and values can be added without disrupting the existing structure.

7. **Reversibility**:
   - The original GS1-128 data can be reconstructed by decoding the query parameters back into the AI-value pairs.

### Example Implementation:
#### Encoding:
If you have the following GS1-128 data:
```
(01)12345678901234(10)ABC123(17)231231
```
Convert it to a URL-safe format:
```
base.com/subcat?01=12345678901234&10=ABC123&17=231231
```

#### Decoding:
Extract the query parameters from the URL and reconstruct the GS1-128 data:
```
(01)12345678901234(10)ABC123(17)231231
```

---

### Handling Unsafe Characters:
If the batch number contains unsafe characters (e.g., `ABC#123`), encode them:
```
base.com/subcat?01=12345678901234&10=ABC%23123&17=231231
```
When decoding, URL-decode the values to retrieve the original batch number (`ABC#123`).

---

### Conclusion:
Your proposed format is a practical and scalable solution for encoding GS1-128 data into a URL-safe format. It maintains readability, is compatible with standard URL parsing, and allows for easy reconstruction of the original GS1-128 data. Just ensure that any unsafe characters in the values are properly URL-encoded for robustness.
