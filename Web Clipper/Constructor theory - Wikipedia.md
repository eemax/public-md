**Constructor Theory**

Constructor theory is a proposal in fundamental physics developed by David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto at the University of Oxford. It aims to express physical laws in terms of possible and impossible transformations, or tasks, rather than focusing on the components involved. This approach introduces counterfactuals into physics, allowing for new laws to be expressed, such as the constructor theory of information. The theory integrates ideas from thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, information theory, and quantum computation, suggesting that quantum mechanics and other theories are subsidiary. It also proposes that quantum information is a special case of what it terms "superinformation." Constructor theory seeks to provide an explanatory framework for why certain transformations are possible while others are not, addressing gaps in current quantum mechanics explanations.
