▾BLOG POST

A blog post can be composed of various components from our component repository. Typically, blog posts include breadcrumbs, an avatar, the author’s name, the publication date, and the blog post content.

## POSTCHRISTOPHER ALEXANDER  
1-1-2002

I believe that we have in us a residue of a world-picture which is essentially mechanical in nature – what we might call the mechanist-rationalist world picture ... Like an infection it has entered us, it affects our actions, it affects our morals, it affects our sense of beauty.

This is a picture of a world made of atoms which whirl around in a mechanical fashion: a world in which it is assumed that all the universe is a blind mechanism, whirling on its way, under the impact of the ‘laws of nature.’ These laws are, essentially, those mechanistic laws which explain how the atoms and the structures made of these atoms proceed on their way ... Even though we would admit that the precise laws and mechanisms may not be known, we assume that underlying our ignorance there are some laws, not quite formulated, which do account for how things work ...

I have reached the conclusion that the strange fantasies, the private in-house language about architecture, the strange nature of 20th-century gallery art, deconstructionism, postmodernism, modernism and a host of other ‘isms’, all of which affect our physical world hugely, are created because of an entanglement between the nature of architecture, the practice of architecture, and the mechanical conception of the universe.

More precisely, I believe that the mistake and confusion in our picture of the the art of building has come from our conception of what matter is.

The present conception of matter, and the opposing one which I shall try to put in its place, may both be summarized by the nature of order. Our idea of matter is essentially governed by our idea of order ... So it is the nature of order which lies at the root of the problem of architecture ...

When we understand what order is, I believe we shall better understand what matter is and then what the universe itself is.

  

▾BREADCRUMBS

Breadcrumbs display the current page or context within a website or application. They show the hierarchy and navigation path, helping users understand their location. Breadcrumbs allow users to navigate back through levels or categories and are especially useful for deeply nested pages.

## EXAMPLE

  

▾BUTTONS

Button components are essential interactive elements within SRCL, facilitating actions like navigation, form submission, and command execution.

## EXAMPLE

  

Disabled Button

  

▾BUTTON GROUP

Button groups organize related actions within a shared container, offering quick access to frequently used tasks. These buttons are visually connected to emphasize their relationship and can also indicate a selected state.

## EXAMPLE

  

▾CARDS

Cards are MS-DOS–inspired sections designed to group related content and actions. They can serve as standalone features or function as part of a larger application. Each card clearly outlines key information, making it easier for users to identify and interact with important details.

## Left-A

## Right-B

## C

To seek the timeless way we must first know the quality without a name. There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named.

  

## Left-A

## Right-B

## C

The structure of life I have described in buildings - the structure which I believe to be objective - is deeply and inextricably connected with the human person, and with the innermost nature of human feeling.

  

## Left-A

## Right-B

## C

We are searching for some kind of harmony between two intangibles: a form which we have not yet designed and a context which we cannot properly describe.

  

▾CHECKBOX

Checkboxes represent a binary choice, letting users toggle options on or off. Each Checkbox operates independently, allowing multiple selections without affecting others. Checkboxes are ideal for forms, surveys, or scenarios requiring multi-selection, providing a simple way for user input.

## EXAMPLE

The past, though a tutor, is not a thing to lament, but a wellspring of wisdom from which we draw without regret.

A measure of obsession doth sharpen the will, for the long path, though beset with trials, leadeth ever toward glories.

Kindness and gratitude must light our way in all dealings, regardless of circumstance.

Stand firm beside thy fellow for shared triumph is the sweetest of all.

Let us strive that design be not a mere ornament to the world, but a worthy service to humanity itself.

Artifacts built with care do grant webmasters the power to shape their own fates, and to serve those thou dost cherish is an honor beyond measure.

Intensity, as fire contained, burneth most brightly when turned toward aims; thus, let us spurn the call of mediocrity and cast aside the seductions of decay.

Mistakes are not curses, but treasures wrapped in adversity, offered to those wise enough to seize their lessons.

Expect naught, but receive all with gratitude, and find a place of trust wherein thou mayest dwell for a time.

From thy master learn what thou canst, and from all others likewise, for wisdom hath many guises.

To follow with discipline is good; to follow oneself with discipline is better.

Work with fervor and take joy where it may be found, for the making is as sweet as the outcome.

Be mindful that there are ever more ways than two, and seek not merely to follow the trade but to alter its course, bringing value wherever it is given thee to do so.

Whether rewarded or not, let us ply our craft for the love of it, for therein lies mastery.

Assume nothing, and let no person escape thy regard.

A fine process doth honor the task, but let the result be no less fine.

Keep faith with those who make promises, and shouldst thou be called to push others, push thyself the harder.

Thy health is thy treasure, and building a company shall be no graceful dance, but a contest of strife.

Take always the first step, for even in failure doth wisdom grow.

Seek ever to broaden thy knowledge of art, software, music, letters, and all things ancient and new, for these are the treasures of the mind.

Thy fate lieth ever in thine own hands, and the soul readeth not only the landscape, but the heart that beats beneath it.

Let thy voice be thine own, unborrowed and unbowed, and make it heard without fear.

Rejoice in the victories of thy fellow webmasters, for in bearing witness to their triumphs is joy in its truest form.

Grow accustomed to the weight of pressure, for in such a forge is the finest steel tempered.

Thus do we press onward—undaunted and unyielding—in pursuit of a better physical and digital world.

▾BAD BISHOP

The “Bad Bishop” describes a bishop locked on squares of its own color by its own pawns, stifling its mobility. In this example from chess.com, Black’s bishop on B-7 is hindered by its own pawns and cannot be freed easily. Coincidentally, Bad Bishop is also one of the best Seattle bars (704 1st Ave), it is known for its creative cocktails and lively atmosphere.

▾CHECKMATE

In chess, the en passant rule allows a pawn to capture an enemy pawn that has just made a two-square advance, moving to the square it bypassed as if it had only advanced one square. This unique rule prevents a pawn from escaping capture by skipping past an opponent. In the scenario below, White uses en passant to deliver checkmate, leaving Black’s king with no legal moves.

▾DASHBOARD RADAR EXAMPLE

The Dashboard Radar Example is a visual homage to Brian Wyvill, the creator of the iconic Nostromo interface in Alien 1979. This example using SRCL components recreates the orbital simulations that brought a sense of realism to the movie’s early scenes.

The original AOS (Alien Orbit Simulator) was inspired by the moment when the Nostromo’s crew awakens to decipher a distress signal, this adapation depicts the kind of graphical representation that could chart complex trajectories around distant planets.

  

▾DENABASE EXAMPLE

The Denabase component is a tribute to the work of Territory Studio in the movie Blade Runner 2049. It draws inspiration from a DNA database containing an archive of individual DNA cards. They explored various card systems to capture a sense of physicality.

▾DIALOG

Dialog components overlay the main content—reminiscent of early graphical interfaces—to capture a user’s focus for tasks requiring input, a choice, or confirmation without leaving the current context.

## EXAMPLE

  

▾DIVIDER

A divider separates sections of content, creating clear distinctions between related groups. It is typically a line or space, oriented horizontally or vertically based on the layout. Divider helps organize information, improve readability, and enhance the interface’s clarity and structure.

## ENTROPY

Any sense of order or stability inevitably crumbles. The entire universe follows a dismal trek toward a dull state of ultimate turmoil.  
To keep track of this cosmic decay, physicists employ a concept called entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorderliness, and the declaration that entropy is always on the rise — known as the second law of thermodynamics — is among nature’s most inescapable commandments.  
I have long felt haunted by the universal tendency toward messiness. Order is fragile. It takes months of careful planning and artistry to craft a vase but an instant to demolish it with a soccer ball. We spend our lives struggling to make sense of a chaotic and unpredictable world, where any attempt to establish control seems only to backfire.  
The second law demands that machines can never be perfectly efficient, which implies that whenever structure arises in the universe, it ultimately serves only to dissipate energy further — be it a star that eventually explodes or a living organism converting food into heat. We are, despite our best intentions, agents of entropy.  
“Nothing in life is certain except death, taxes and the second law of thermodynamics,” wrote Seth Lloyd, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There’s no sidestepping this directive. The growth of entropy is deeply entwined with our most basic experiences, accounting for why time runs forward and why the world appears deterministic rather than quantum mechanically uncertain.

▾DRAWER

A drawer is a panel that slides in from the screen edge, providing space for secondary content, actions, or navigation links while keeping the main content uninterrupted.

## INTRO(1)

INTRODUCTION

Section 1 of the manual describes user commands and tools, for example, file manipulation tools, shells, compilers, web browsers, file and image viewers and editors, and so on. All commands yield a status value on termination. This value can be tested (e.g., in most shells the variable $? contains the status of the last executed command) to see whether the command completed successfully. A zero exit status is conventionally used to indicate success, and a nonzero status means that the command was unsuccessful. (Details of the exit status can be found in wait(2).) A nonzero exit status can be in the range 1 to 255, and some commands use different nonzero status values to indicate the reason why the command failed.

  

▾DROPDOWN MENU

A dropdown menu is an interactive element that lets users select an option from a collapsible menu, saving space by hiding options until needed.

▾MESSAGES

Messages in this library present a modern messaging experience through an MS-DOS–inspired aesthetic. Instead of rounded speech bubbles, messages appear in simple rectangular boxes, evoking a nostalgic, classic PC feel.

## EXAMPLE

You create the world of the dream, you bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.

How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that its reality?

Well dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right? It's only when we wake up that we realize how things are actually strange.

Let me ask you a question, you, you never really remember the beginning of a dream do you? You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.

So how did we end up here?

  

▾MESSAGES INTERFACE

This example combines the aesthetics of iMessage and IRSSI with a terminal-inspired design. It shows how easy it is to embed a simple web application into your website.

▾KENYA HARA, WHITE

Colors do not exist separately and independently within nature; they are constantly shifting in response to subtle gradations of light. It is language that, magnificently, gives them clear shape.

▾KENYA HARA, WHITE

White can be attained by blending all the colors of the spectrum together, or through the substraction of ink and all other pigments. In short, it is "all colors" and "no color" at the same time.

▾KENYA HARA, WHITE

It is easy to think that beauty resides in the realm of creativity. Yet beauty hardly "appears" from nowhere. Recently, I have come to believe that we "discover" it through the cleaning and polishing we do to preserve things as they are. \[...\] The beauty of a temple garden rests not in the splendid features that were created by a talented designer; rather, its beauty is uncovered through the continual process of cleaning.

▾KENYA HARA, DESIGNING DESIGN

I used to believe that design was information architecture, and also that this architecture was built in the brain of an information recipient. Recently I've come to think that, although the materials of that architecture's construction are indeed the information brought from the outside by the sensory organs, at the same time some very important building blocks are also the recollected experiences, the memories, awakened by these external stimuli. People imagine the world and interpret it when outside stimuli awaken the mountain of their internally stored memories.

▾KENYA HARA, DESIGNING DESIGN

The human brain likes anything that entails a great amount of information. Its excessive capacity waits eagerly to perceive the world by completely exhausting its great receptive powers. That potential power, though, remains today in a state of extreme constriction and is a source of the information stress we're all under.

  

▾POPOVER

Popovers are transient views that appear above content when users interact with an associated element, offering relevant information, details, or interactive content like actions or form elements.

## EXAMPLE

  

▾PROGRESS BARS

▾RADIO BUTTONS

Radio buttons are visual controls that let users make a single selection from a predefined set of mutually exclusive options. Represented as small circles that fill when selected, they are used when all options need to be visible and only one can be chosen.

## METHOD

You’re at the very beginning of designing your operating system. How do you choose to start?

Custom Linux Kernel Derivative: Start with a minimal Linux kernel (e.g., a stripped-down mainline LTS release), integrate essential device drivers, and build out a tailored init process.

AOSP Base: Leverage an AOSP-derived HAL and system services, using BSP integration and existing frameworks as a foundation for rapid device bring-up.

Microkernel Approach: Implement a microkernel (e.g., seL4) to strictly separate core services, relying on IPC mechanisms and user-space servers to manage drivers, file systems, and device I/O.

## INTERFACE

How will you implement your interface layer?

Native GUI Shell + EGL/Wayland: Use a lean, native toolkit with hardware-accelerated rendering (EGL), compositing via Wayland, and minimal shell protocols.

Adapted Android Framework: Employ the Android UI stack (SurfaceFlinger, View hierarchy), integrating Material Components as baseline UI elements, and build custom system apps via Jetpack.

Custom-Compositor + Custom Widgets: Implement a dedicated compositor (e.g., custom Weston derivative) and write your own widget toolkit in C++/Rust, managing input events and layouts directly.

## SECURITY

How will you handle security and lifecycle management?

Signed Kernel/OS Updates + Verified Boot: Use a secure bootloader chain (e.g., U-Boot with verified boot), sign OTA payloads, and apply delta updates with rollback support.

TEE Integration + SELinux Policies: Embed a Trusted Execution Environment (e.g., ARM TrustZone), enforce SELinux policies system-wide, and apply monthly patch-level updates from upstream code sources.

Containerized Services + Granular Permissions: Run system services and third-party apps in containerized sandboxes (LXC, cgroups, seccomp), enforce capability-based permissions, and manage rolling updates at a container or microservice level.

  

▾SELECT

Select components are user interface controls that let users choose an option from a dropdown list. They display a list of options and collapse to show the selected choice, making them ideal for scenarios with limited space and multiple options.

## EXAMPLE

What is your favorite dinosaur?
