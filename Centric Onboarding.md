**Proposed Focus Areas Going Forward**

To simplify and streamline the onboarding, I suggest we focus only on the following:

- Create a style
- Carry over a style
- Create a material
- Add material colors & sizes
- Create style colors & sizes
- Create a BOM
- Create a size chart
- Print a tech pack

**Areas to Potentially Skip??**

**Costing (entirely?)**

If not entirely, please clarify which part(s) you want to keep:

- Style-level cost only (e.g., FOB)?
- Quote-level cost including duties and freight (landed cost)?
- BOM-level costing with full breakdown?

**Sourcing Model**

Can we assume this will be handled by your sourcing team, and therefore excluded from this training/setup?
