Your intuition is correct: **tracking raw material batches (vs. POs) is far more strategic and scalable** for sustainability, traceability, and operational efficiency. Here’s why:

### **Why Batch-Level > PO-Level**
1. **Avoids Redundant Data Silos**  
   - A single **batch** of raw material (e.g., 10,000kg of cotton) might be split across **multiple POs** over time. Tracking at the PO level would fragment the batch’s impact data, forcing you to "reinvent the wheel" for each PO.  
   - Example: If Supplier A sends 20% of a cotton batch in PO-1 and 30% in PO-2, PO-level tracking would miss the full batch impact (e.g., water usage, carbon footprint of growing/producing the entire 10,000kg).  

2. **Captures True Environmental Impact**  
   - Sustainability metrics (e.g., GHG emissions, water use) are tied to **production of the batch itself**, not your transactional consumption.  
   - Even if you only use 5% of a batch, you still contribute to the demand for that batch’s total output. Without batch-level data, you cannot accurately calculate your **proportional impact** (e.g., "Our 5% usage drove X tons of CO₂").  

3. **Future-Proofs for Regulations**  
   - Frameworks like CSRD require companies to report on **upstream impacts** (e.g., raw material extraction, processing). PO-level data lacks the granularity to trace materials back to their source.  

4. **Supports Subprocess Traceability**  
   - Subprocesses (e.g., dyeing, spinning) often combine multiple batches. Batch-level tracking lets you map how materials flow through these steps, while PO-level data would obscure this.  

5. **Reduces Supplier Complexity**  
   - Suppliers often reuse the same batch across multiple customers. Batch tracking lets you leverage their existing production data (e.g., "This dyehouse processed 50 batches this year; our styles used 3 of them").

### **Where PO-Level Tracking Fails**
- **POs are transactional**, not material-centric: They focus on “What did we buy?” and “When?” but not “Where did it come from?” or “What’s its full lifecycle impact?”  
- **Aggregation is messy**: If you later want to calculate the total impact of a material (e.g., all cotton used in 2024), you’d need to reverse-engineer dozens/hundreds of POs to map them back to batches.  
- **Risk of double-counting or gaps**: A PO might include multiple batches, or a batch might span multiple POs.

### **Your Approach Solves the Root Problem**  
By starting with **raw material batches**, you:  
6. **Build a single source of truth** for all materials, regardless of how they’re divided into POs.  
7. **Enable impact allocation** (e.g., “We used 30% of Batch X, so we account for 30% of its impact”).  
8. **Simplify compliance** with laws like the EU Digital Product Passport, which will require batch-level traceability.  
9. **Empower sourcing teams** to negotiate with suppliers using data (e.g., “Batch Y from Factory Z has a 20% lower carbon footprint—prioritize it”).

### **When PO-Level Data Still Matters**
POs aren’t irrelevant—they’re just not the **starting point**. Once batches are mapped, you can:  
- Link POs to their underlying batches (e.g., PO-123 → Batches A, B, C).  
- Use POs for **operational workflows** (e.g., delivery timelines, costs) while relying on batches for **impact/sustainability metrics**.  

---

### **Practical Example**  
**Scenario**: You buy 1,000kg of recycled polyester.  
- **Batch Approach**: Track the entire 5,000kg batch produced by Supplier X. Even though you only used 20%, you calculate your 20% share of its impact (energy, emissions, waste).  
- **PO Approach**: Track only the 1,000kg in your PO. You miss the fact that the remaining 4,000kg went to other brands, and your impact reporting is incomplete.

### **Conclusion**  
Your batch-first strategy is **not just suitable—it’s necessary** for credible sustainability reporting and supply chain resilience. PO-level tracking is a downstream transactional tool; batch-level tracking addresses the root of traceability and impact. By structuring Segura around batches, you avoid fragmented data and position the company to meet evolving stakeholder demands (investors, regulators, consumers).  

The only exception? If your supply chain is hyper-simplified (e.g., one batch = one PO), but this is rare in fashion/apparel. For most brands, batch-level is the way to go.
