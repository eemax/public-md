## Clarifications and discussions needed
- We need to involve the sourcing and buying teams. We likely need additional resources that help us map the batches.
- We need to clarify if we can use PO as batch number.
	- Involve buying and logistics

## Changes to be done in systems
### Centric
Need to change the workflow in BOM to label everything needed for traceability. I see this as the best and only way of doing it.
To be discussed:
- What exactly do we need to include in our reporting and display?
	- It probably need to be everything and total to 100% of material
	- What about trims, packaging, and others?
### Segura
Need to change to include all different levels of data
- Need PO level (product)
- Need material including subprocesses
	- Additionally need material and subprocesses per batch
- Need raw materials
	- Additionally need raw materials per batch
