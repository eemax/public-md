It might be important to have a /21/serial and create a system that can append our database by scanning it from a machine. like if a product get picked, it should be scanned and then a manual reference it getting inputted. we later review this reference and can add the correct data to it. If a third party is doing the enrichment they can provide us with the appropriate data.

or, 

we might not even need to append for such minor trims. in that case we just proceed with /10/batch

## why a system for appending is important
we need to be able to append using a simple scan for various reason.
there will be enrichments, repair, recycle etc and we need to be able to easily append things and linking them to the right place and adding the correct data to that dpp
