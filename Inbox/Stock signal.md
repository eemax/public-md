Buying Strategy: The person buys stocks that are within 10% to 15% of their 52-week low, provided these stocks show some signs of price support. This approach is contrarian because it involves buying when prices are low, which is contrary to the usual trend-following strategy.

Selling Strategy: If a stock drops to a new low (except for some rare exceptions), they sell it to cut losses. This is the practical side of the strategy, focusing on minimizing risk.

Risk Management: The strategy balances the potential for missing out on greater value with the benefit of avoiding significant losses. Since implementing this rule, the person has not experienced a major loss in their portfolio.
