This has been the case with every DEX airdrop since uniswap.

The airdrop is a "Howey Shield", because they can claim decentralized governance, but since they & the VCs hold the majority - they actually still have as much control as if there was no governance.

This allows them to sell & profit off the coin, because one of the issues with Howey is having the ability to influence price. Faux 'Decentralization' is a way to skirt that.

Always has been; the tokens are only there for devs to dump. The smartest thing to do with any airdrop is dump it the absolute first moment you can.
