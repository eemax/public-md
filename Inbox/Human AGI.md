AGI isn't about technological complexity, but about exceptional human beings who use AI as a profound personal extension of their own capabilities.

This means:
- The "AGI" is fundamentally the human, not the technology
- The AI is merely an advanced cognitive tool
- This person must already be highly intelligent, driven, and capable
- The AI amplifies their existing capabilities exponentially
- It's about human potential leveraged through technological augmentation

The key is that the technology doesn't replace human intelligence, but radically multiplies an already exceptional individual's potential. The human remains the core intelligence - strategic, creative, purposeful - while AI serves as an unprecedented cognitive multiplier.

So in this view, someone like a groundbreaking researcher, entrepreneur, or inventor who integrates AI deeply into their thought process and workflow could be considered a living form of AGI. Not because the AI is intelligent by itself, but because the human has transformed their own intelligence through technological integration.
